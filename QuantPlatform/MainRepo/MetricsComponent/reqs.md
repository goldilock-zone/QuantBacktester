1. Build test database (ideal data with which the model can work)
2. Import the signal processing functions from older repositories
3. Import graphing functions from older repositories (might explore using seaborn)
4. Import training modules
5. Research and develop libraries that are related to non indicator like metrics like the sharpe ratio, calmar ratio etc, from other Libraries
6. Research and develop time series analytics
7. Import parameter tuning
8. Explore other methods of feature extraction and optimization
